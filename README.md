## Overview
This repository accompanies the Jupyter Notebook **`Group_T22_report.ipynb`**, which documents our Mobile Robotics project end-to-end: from sensor calibration and state estimation (Kalman filtering) to occupancy-grid mapping, global path planning and local obstacle avoidance, all the way to on-robot execution (via tdmclient) and reproducible simulations. It explains the rationale behind each module, visualizes intermediate results (plots and debug overlays), and ties them together into a modular pipeline for autonomous navigation. The goal is to provide a clear, reusable baseline that others can run, adapt, and extend for their own robots or course projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+ (3.10 recommended)
- Jupyter Lab or Notebook

### Installation
Create and activate an environment, then install dependencies (edit as needed):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you use Conda, create an environment and install packages:
```bash
conda create -n t22 python=3.10 -y
conda activate t22
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. Clone this repository and navigate into it:
   ```bash
   git clone <YOUR_REPO_URL>.git
   cd <YOUR_REPO_NAME>
   ```

2. Create the environment and install dependencies (choose one):

   **Conda (recommended)**
   ```bash
   conda create -n t22 python=3.10 -y
   conda activate t22
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Poetry**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   poetry run jupyter lab
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab  # or: jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run all cells (Kernel → Restart & Run All) to reproduce the results.

## Data
If your workflow uses local datasets, place them under `data/`. The notebook currently references the following files (detected heuristically from code and markdown); ensure they exist or update the paths:
_No data files were auto-detected from code cells._

## Results & Figures
Figures generated by the notebook can be saved to `reports/figures/`. The notebook references the following images in markdown (if any):
- `attachment:860085be-3141-4379-b053-5f540119603f.png`

## Dependencies
A minimal `requirements.txt` might include:
- typing
- numpy
- math
- mapping
- Path_planning
- kalman
- astolficontrol
- local_nav
- tdmclient
- matplotlib
- cv2
- time

> Tip: pin versions after testing to ensure reproducibility.

## Repository Structure

## Reproducing the Analysis
- Open `notebook/Group_T22_report.ipynb` and run all cells.
- If the notebook expects specific data files, download or place them under `data/` as described above.
- To export results, adapt the last section of the notebook to save figures/tables into `reports/`.
